Capstone Portfolio: 
A Comprehensive Study of Sleep, Age, and Mental Health Dynamics

Project Overview:
This project aims to investigate relationships between sleep duration, age, and mental health conditions. By examining sleep patterns, self-rated mental health scales, and types of mental health disorders, this study provides insights into the complex factors influencing mental health outcomes. The primary research goal is to contribute a comprehensive dataset that aids researchers and policymakers in understanding and addressing mental health disparities.

Objectives:
Sleep and Mental Health: Analyze the impact of varying sleep durations on self-reported mental health ratings.
Age and Mental Health: Examine the correlation between age and mental health ratings.
Mental Health Disorders and Age: Investigate the distribution of different mental health disorders across age groups.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Conducted through an anonymous online survey, collecting demographic information, mental health conditions, sleep patterns, and self-reported mental health ratings on a 1-10 scale.
Data Preprocessing: Raw data processed in R, with cleaning steps to remove unnecessary variables, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables for analysis.

Analysis Techniques:
ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc analysis for comparing group means.
Regression and Spearman’s rank correlation to examine relationships between age and mental health.
Descriptive statistics, boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots for data visualization.

Key Findings:
Sleep Duration and Mental Health: Statistical analysis found a significant association between sleep duration and mental health ratings, with patterns indicating that longer sleep duration correlates with higher mental health ratings.
Age and Mental Health: No significant linear or monotonic relationship between age and mental health ratings was observed.
Disorder Type and Age: Age was not found to be a distinguishing factor in the prevalence of specific mental health disorders.
